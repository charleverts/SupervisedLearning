# SupervisedLearning

This repo contains my code and final submissions for the 3 Assignments completed as part of the Supervised Learning module in the MPhil Fintech program.

### Assignment 1: 
Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models built to predict the tip percentage of customers using the Californian Tips Dataset. 

### Assignment 2: 
Logistic regression, Classification Trees, Bagging & Random Forest & Gradient Boosting to predict the occupancy of an officespace. 

### Asignment 3:
Support Vector Machines and Neural Network models built to predict whether a patient will suffer from cornoary heart disease within the next ten years using the Framingham Risk Score dataset.
